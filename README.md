# painless-link

The motivation for â€˜painless-linkâ€™ has arisen when splitting a large project into many small submodules. These submodules should be used in several projects. To ensure this, we have linked the various submodules with the packages via â€˜npm linkâ€™.

With the number of submodules, the number of symlinks has also increased. Therefore, we decided to use â€˜painless-linkâ€™ - a configurable and fully automatic symlink solution based on â€˜npm linkâ€™. 

In the main project, the symlinks are specified in the â€˜package.jsonâ€™ in property â€˜linkedDependenciesâ€™. â€˜painless-link` tracks all â€˜linkedDependenciesâ€™ and resolves their â€˜linkedDependenciesâ€™ recursively. No time-consuming Bash scripts and / or no time-consuming navigation through the individual subprojects ðŸ’ª 

Great solutions such as [Lerna.js](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) were unthinkable at the time, as the VCS SVN was used.

## Installation

**As global**

`npm install -g painless-link`

**or as package dependency**

`npm install --save-dev painless-link`

## How to use

1. Add to `package.json` every dependency which should be resolved as following:

```json
{
  "linkedDepedancies": {
    "dependencyA": "../modules/dependencyA" 
  }
}
```

2. Add painless-link to your scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "painless-link"
  }
}
```

### Every linked dependency should have a `package.json`

## Roadmap
Every project can be optimised and also this package has a huge roadmap ðŸ¤“
- make it more painless ðŸ˜‹
- better error handling
- own symlink system, for avoiding collision with existing linked npm packages
- configuration file for extending `painless-link`
- create test cases for node, webpack, etc.
- build CLI interface for more options like verbose mode
- environment specific linking like only linking in `NODE_ENV=development`
